Exploring the Intersection of Vedas and Science

## Overview
This project aims to leverage data science techniques to extract and analyze knowledge from the ancient texts of the Vedas. By applying modern analytical methods, we seek to uncover insights and wisdom embedded in these texts, providing a deeper understanding of our past and its relevance to contemporary science.

## Objectives
- Digitize and preprocess Vedic texts for analysis.
- Apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract meaningful information.
- Perform data analysis to identify patterns and correlations within the texts.
- Develop visualizations to present findings in an accessible manner.
